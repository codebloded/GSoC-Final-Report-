## My Work in Project

My work in project is to add features to allow teachers to give assignments to students.Assignmets are handle by teacher from the sugarizer-server dashboard.

My project is divided into two phases:
1. [Sugarizer-server](https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer-server)
2. [Sugarizer](https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer) (Client Application)

I created some APIs for assignment feature in sugarizer-server. Also created some UIs called views in sugarizer-server dashboard to interact with assignments.
------More to add------

## ✔️ Work Completed
### Phase 1 Sugarizer-server (Dashboard)

Features Implemented :
I made up some APIs 
- Create Asignmets
- Edit Assignments
- Delete Assignmemts
- Launch Assignment: This APIs is used for Launching the assignment which means assignment goes to every student associated to the assignment.
- Return Assignment: This API made `isSubmitted:false` and update the `status:null` 
- Submit Assignment: This API made `isSubmitted:false` and update `submissinDate: new Date().getTime()`

I have build some Screens in dashboard.

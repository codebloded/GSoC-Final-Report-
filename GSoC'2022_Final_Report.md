## My Work in Project

My work in the project is to add features to allow teachers to give assignments to students. Assignments are handled by a teacher from the sugarizer-server dashboard. 

My project is divided into two phases:
1. [Sugarizer-server](https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer-server)
2. [Sugarizer](https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer) (Client Application)

I created some APIs for assignment feature in sugarizer-server. Also created some UIs called views in sugarizer-server dashboard to interact with assignments.
------More to add------
